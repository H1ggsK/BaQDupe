# BaQDupe (Book and Quill Dupe)
This is a dupe for vanilla, Fabric, and Forge servers (1.20.5-1.21.1), and Paper servers running 1.20.5 through 1.21 (not 1.21.1).  It does not work on Purpur or any other server plugin softwares.

# How to use
Start by running `/dupehelp`, and then following the instructions run `/dupe`. If it fails, it may be patched. DM me `@h1ggsk` on Discord if you have a problem, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. You can also join our duping support Discord server at [discord.gg/ttDpeJQSvK](https://discord.gg/ttDpeJQSvK).

To connect to other server versions than 1.21/1.21.1, use [ViaFabricPlus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viafabricplus).

If you used PaperDupe, please delete the `.jar` file and replace it with the BaQDupe `.jar`.
